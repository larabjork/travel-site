> User stories
* As a user, I want to GET and POST reviews about travel destinations.
* As a user, I want to GET reviews by country or city.
* As a user, I want to see the most popular travel destinations by number of reviews or by overall rating.
* As a user, I want to PUT and DELETE reviews, but only if I wrote them. (Start by requiring a user_name param to match the user_name of the author on the message. * You can always try authentication later.)
* As a user, I want to look up random destinations just for fun.

To do:
* authentication with bcrypt (& JWT) √
  * sign_up
  * sign_out
* search method
* authorization to delete if user_id == review user_id
* sort method
* random method

* Using Swagger for Documentation? √?
* **Heroku**
* **Paginating an API?**
* Serialization?
* Batching API calls?
* Rate Limiting?
* API Versioning?
* more testing?
